# Architecture Decision Record

Adopt Next.js App Router Scaffold

**Turn**: 1

**Status**: Proposed

**Date**: 2025-10-08 - 00:05

**Context**
The ui-nextjs application implementation pattern mandates a Next.js App Router project with Tailwind CSS and supporting tooling. The existing repository has no frontend scaffold.

**Options Considered**
- Generate the prescribed Next.js structure with required tooling files.
- Delay scaffolding until additional product specifications are processed.

**Decision**
Proceed with generating the full Next.js App Router scaffold, ensuring configuration aligns with the pattern defaults and establishing required tooling for linting, testing, and CI.

**Result**
Planned creation of package.json, Next.js configuration, Tailwind setup, testing harness, and CI workflow files.

**Consequences**
- Provides deterministic baseline for future feature work.
- Introduces dependency installation requirements and ongoing maintenance for tooling updates.
