# Architecture Decision Record

Initialize Next.js Scaffolding Baseline

**Turn**: 1

**Status**: Accepted

**Date**: 2025-10-07T18:19:47Z

**Context**
The project requires a scalable Next.js App Router application aligned with the ui-nextjs pattern, including Tailwind styling, testing harnesses, and governance metadata.

**Options Considered**
1. Generate a minimal Next.js app without tooling integrations.
2. Scaffold the full pattern-prescribed stack with Tailwind, linting, testing, and CI automation.

**Decision**
Adopt option 2 to comply with the application implementation pattern and provide a ready-to-extend foundation with linting, testing, and CI hooks configured from day one.

**Result**
Created Next.js 15 scaffolding, Tailwind configuration, testing setup (Vitest, Playwright), environment validation utilities, and CI workflow files with governance metadata headers.

**Consequences**
- Positive: Ensures immediate developer productivity and compliance with governance standards.
- Positive: Establishes repeatable tooling for subsequent feature turns.
- Negative: Introduces initial configuration overhead that must be maintained as dependencies evolve.
