Short answer: convert the PRD into a machine-readable “Spec Pack” and gate it with a design review. That’s the next step in a spec-driven workflow.

Below is the concrete plan plus first artifacts to kick it off.

# Next Step: Spec Pack v0.1 (contract-first)

Deliverables (all text files, reviewable in PR):

1. Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM): map every FR/NFR → APIs/data/contracts → tests → metrics.
2. Contract-first API spec: OpenAPI for registration endpoints; auth and rate-limit headers; error model.
3. JSON Schemas: request/response payloads; consent + preferences; validation rules.
4. Event Schemas: analytics/audit events (CloudEvents-style) for funnel instrumentation.
5. Acceptance tests: Gherkin for key scenarios; load/A11y test charters.
6. NFR budgets: performance SLOs, reliability targets, security & compliance controls.
7. Observability spec: metrics, logs, dashboards, alerts; success metric formulas.
8. ADRs: crisp decisions for OTP channel policy, code length/TTL, identifier strategy, data retention.

Gate: “Spec Pack Review” — Security, Compliance, Analytics, and App Eng sign-off. After approval, scaffolding and code generation begin.

# Artifact 3 — Event schemas (excerpt)

* registration.started { registrationId, emailHash, locale, ts }
* registration.otp_sent { registrationId, channel, provider, ts }
* registration.otp_verified { registrationId, ts }
* registration.completed { registrationId, customerId, ts }
* registration.throttled { registrationId?, reason, ts }
  (All events: no raw PII; include correlationId and partition keys.)

# Artifact 4 — Acceptance tests (Gherkin excerpt)

- Feature: Customer Registration
- Scenario: Happy path with email OTP
- Given a new user starts registration with valid email/password and locale
- When the user requests an email OTP
- And enters the correct OTP within 5 minutes
- And submits required personal info, consent, and preferences
- Then the system creates a customer record and returns a customerId
- And emits events registration.started, registration.otp_sent, registration.otp_verified, registration.completed

# Definition of Ready to Implement

* PRD v0.1 approved.
* Spec Pack v0.1 committed:

    * OpenAPI validated (lint passes).
    * JSON Schemas compiled.
    * Events documented.
    * RTM links each FR/NFR to at least one test and one metric.
    * ADRs drafted for OTP policy and identifier strategy.
* Tooling ready: CI validates OpenAPI/JSON Schema; test harness can run Gherkin E2E stubs; telemetry namespaces reserved.
